    "<b>What is the goal of data visualization?<b> \n",
    "    \n",
    "It is a mode of communication in which we have insight regarding data and a potential audience (viewers) we would like to convey these insights to. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Why is data visualization important to be carefully curated?<b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "In data visualization, a story will naturally develop in a viewer's mind. If we don’t provide a clear story ourselves, then a viewer will create their own, whether accurate or not. In addition, the viewer may think “this is boring,” “the author is wrong,” or “the author is incompetent\" which misses the mark on the important role that stories play in reasoning and memory. Data visualization should be telling a story that is based on facts and logical reasoning to gain trust from viewers and to get them interested and excited. Telling this story through figures does not mean making something up, overselling something, or manipulating; instead, it means the communication should be clear and interesting enough to capture a viewer's attention and help them remember the information. \n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot assume that the viewer can see figures and immediately infer the points we are trying to make or assume that the viewer can rapidly process complex visualizations / understand the key trends and relationships that are shown. We have to be intentional with helping the viewer understand the meaning of our visualizations and see the same patterns in the data that we see. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Key Idea: <b>\n",
    "    \n",
    "In data visualization, it is essential to accurately and clearly convey information in a captivating way without misleading the viewer. "
